## Send random mails

I created this script for to send a lot of emails to a specific account.

I needed to test the performance of a gmail account with a lot of emails. The account would be integrated inside a CRM. It was not possible to use a real account so, I created this script for to send a lot of e-mails (with and without attachemtns) to a test account for to emulate it's performance.
