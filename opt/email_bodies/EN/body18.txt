Here’s a round up of what has been a fairly calm day after last week’s North Korea- inspired uncertainties.

There was some mixed economic news across the globe. In Japan, the country’s GDP grew at 4% on an annualised basis in the second quarter, compared to expectations of 2.5% growth.

But eurozone industrial production disappointed, falling by 0.6% in June compared to the 0.5% decline analysts had been expecting.

And in Portugal, GDP growth fell from 1% in the first quarter to 0.2% in the second, albeit it grew by 2.8% on an annualised basis.

But stock markets recovered some ground, on the basis that no news is good news as far as any repeat of last week’s intemperate rhetoric from North Korea and the US was concerned.

The FTSE 100 is up 0.47%, Germany’s Dax is 1.16% better and France’s Cac has climbed 0.85%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open just over 100 points higher.

On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow for - among other things - the UK inflation figures.
