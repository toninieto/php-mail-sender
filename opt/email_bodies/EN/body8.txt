London traders are catching their breaths after the most volatile day for some months. So here’s a closing summary.

The British pound has soared to its highest levels of the year after Theresa May stunned Westminster, and the City, by calling for a general election on June 8th. Sterling has gained two cents against the US dollar, and is also up against the euro tonight.

The strength of sterling helped to wipe more than £45bn off the value of companies on the FTSE 100. The blue-chip index closed down 180 points, due to the strong pound hitting the value of overseas earnings, plus a fall in commodity prices.

Some analysts have predicted that a large Tory win would make a ‘hard Brexit’ more likely. Others have argued that it would allow May to resist pressure from hard-line eurosceptic MPs, and cut a more moderate deal with Europe.

Economists also argue that the election raises the chances of a ‘transitional deal’ after 2019 (when Brexit should have happened), as the next government won’t need to hold another election until 2022.

City firms have been racing to revise their forecasts. Deutsche Bank was forced to rip up its bets against the pound, and promised to release new forecasts soon.

There are also concerns that the election could hurt the UK economy, if it deters firms from committing to fresh investment.

But in brighter news, the International Monetary Fund has revised up its forecast for UK growth this year - from 1.5% to a punchy 2%.

That’s all for tonight. Our Politics Live blog is tracking all the latest developments this evening. GW
