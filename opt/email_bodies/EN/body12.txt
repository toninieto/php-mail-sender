Markets remain calm ahead of the Jackson Hole speeches from ECB boss Mario Draghi and US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen.

Most analysts expect the central bankers to be cautious about their comments, especially Draghi.

Elsewhere there were more indications of the strength of the German economy, with second quarter GDP growth of 0.6%, although a key business sentiment index slipped slightly.

But in the US, durable goods orders slumped in July.

Meanwhile, the head of the White House’s national economic council, Gary Cohn, has told the Financial Times he came under “enormous pressure” to quit his post after Donald Trump’s Charlottesville comments but felt duty bound to carry on. He also suggested Trump would move forward with tax reforms next week.

And with Hurricane Harvey heading for Texas, oil prices have moved higher on fears of disruption to production.

On the markets the FTSE 100 is currently up 0.3% , Germany’s Dax is 0.2% higher and France’s Cac has climbed 0.13%.

The pound is currently up 0.23% at $1.1.2828 and 0.13% better at €1.0864.

With the recent pressure on the pound, there has been some talk it could reach parity with the euro, but ING thinks this is unlikely.

On that note it’s time to close for the day.

Keep an eye on the Business site for reports from Jackson Hole.

Meanwhile, thanks for all your comments and we’ll be back next week.
