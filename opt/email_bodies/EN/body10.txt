With a combination of the US attack on Syria and much weaker than expected jobs numbers for March, it is no surprise that Wall Street has got off to a cautious start.

But there is no real panic selling, and after an initial dip the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now just about in positive territory, up 5 points or 0.03% . The S&P 500 opened down a mere 0.09% and the Nasdaq Composite is marginally ahead.

In Europe Germany’s Dax is down 0.3% and France’s Cac 0.1%. The FTSE 100 has added 0.3%, helped by a good performance from Randgold Resources as the gold price climbs.

On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments and we’ll be back on Monday.
