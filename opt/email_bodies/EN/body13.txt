The UK economy grew by 0.3% in the third quarter, in line with the initial estimates.

But consumer spending, exports and business investment all proved disappointing. The weak pound following the Brexit vote has hit people’s pockets but not proved as much of a benefit to exporters as expected. The consumer squeeze left retail sales at their weakest since July 2016, according to the CBI.

And although the third quarter figure was an improvement on the 0.2% growth in the first three months of the year, it still means the UK is showing the slowest growth among the G7 economies.

But the pound regained some ground following the GDP numbers, after languishing at 8 year lows against the euro. Investors remained cautious ahead of Friday’s key speeches from the ECB and Federal Reserve at the Jackson Hole symposium in the US.

Meanwhile UK car production grew in July ahead of the summer shutdown.

Elsewhere the Spanish economy continued to put in a good performance, while French business confidence rose in August.

In the US weekly jobs claims edged higher but were lower than analyst forecast.

On the stock markets, the FTSE 100 is up 0.5% and the FTSE 250 is holding steady despite a slump in Dixons Carphone shares after a surprise profit warning.

Germany’s Dax is up 0.5% and France’s Cac has climbed 0.3%.

On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.
