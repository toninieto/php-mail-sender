On a busy day, UK public finances showed a surprise surplus of £184m in July, compared to forecasts of a £1bn deficit. The number was boosted by higher than expected tax receipts.

Meanwhile the latest CBI industrial trends survey brought positive news on manufacturing orders and exports.

In Germany, however, there was a surprise drop in economic sentiment.

On the foreign exchanges, the pound continues to weaken, thanks to Brexit concerns and a revival in the dollar.

On the corporate front, Provident Financial saw its shares slump after the UK lender issued another profit warning, bade farewell to its chief executive, abandoned its dividend and revealed an investigation by regulators into its Vanquis Bank.

Elsewhere the Pensions Regulator said it would prosecute Dominic Chappell for failing to provide documents it requested during its investigation into the sale of BHS.

Stock markets have regained some poise, with the FTSE 100 up 0.8% despite the collapse in Provident Financial’s shares. Germany’s Dax is currently 1% higher while France’s Cac has climbed 0.75%.

On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back bright and early tomorrow.
