Here’s a round up of the day’s events.

UK inflation was flat, with the consumer price index coming in at 2.3% in March for the second month in a row.

That was still the highest level for more than three years, and raises the question of whether the Bank of England should raise interest rates.

But with wage growth slowing, real incomes are being hit.

UK house prices rose by 5.8% in February but London saw its slowest growth since April 2012.

Elsewhere a leading investment group has described the actions of Barclays boss Jes Staley in trying to unmask a whistleblower as “amazing” in the light of attempts to encourage people with concerns to come forward.

German economic sentiment improved in April but eurozone industrial production was disappointing.

On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.
