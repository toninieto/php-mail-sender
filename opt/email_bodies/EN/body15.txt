That’s it for the day and the big news came from the European Central Bank minutes and UK retail sales.

ECB minutes revealed that the Bank’s policymakers are fretting about the euro “overshooting” against other currencies. That’s a concern because a strong euro would make exports from the 19-nation single currency bloc less competitive. The release of the minutes sent the euro on a downward trajectory.

In the UK, retail sales were up 0.3% month on month in July, slightly ahead of a forecast of 0.2%, an encouraging sign coming hot on the heels of an apparent easing of the cost of living squeeze. However June’s retail sales figure was revised downwards from 0.6% to 0.3%.

Elsewhere, European markets took a turn for the worse after a winning streak and the FTSE was down by mid-afternoon, after lacklustre results from B&Q owner Kingfisher and Mecca Bingo owner Rank.

On that note, it’s time to put the blog back into hibernation. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back bright and early tomorrow with all the latest developments.
