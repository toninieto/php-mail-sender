Across Europe, with growing numbers of baby boomers clinging to their office chairs, it has become harder for unskilled and semi-skilled young people to find work. Even graduates struggle to find work commensurate with their expertise.

“Europe needs an immediate answer on growth, youth and security issues,” said Sandro Gozi, Italian secretary of state for European affairs at a meeting of European leaders in Italy last month.

Most European leaders have wrung their hands and expressed their sympathy for the young as first the financial crash and then a succession of crises sent unemployment rates for 15- to 24-year-olds soaring.

Earlier this year, François Hollande described France’s unemployment rate as an “economic and social emergency”. Announcing a €2bn (£1.7bn) jobs package, the French president said he was particularly upset at a youth unemployment rate that had topped 24%.

His answer was deeply traditional – before the end of the year he intended to put 500,000 unemployed into vocational training programmes, in addition to the 150,000 announced last October.

To tackle youth unemployment more specifically, 150,000 would be enrolled in civic service volunteer programmes, almost three times as many as the 60,000 youngsters enrolled in 2015.

State-run training programmes are nothing new in France and are often used to fill a jobs void. The suspicion must be that when the July youth unemployment figures for the eurozone showed a drop of 136,000, and France’s unemployment rate fell below 10% for the first time in his presidency, the falls could be largely attributed to Hollande’s civic service scheme, rather than a resurgent private sector.
