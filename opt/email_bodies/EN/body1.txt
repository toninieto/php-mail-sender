Mixed day for European markets

Caution was the watchword for investors, ahead of some key events later in the week, notably the UK budget, the latest meeting of the European Central Bank, and the US non-farm payroll numbers.

With President Trump knocking healthcare shares after reinforcing the idea of cutting drug prices, markets were struggling for direction. The final scores in Europe showed:

The FTSE 100 finished down 11.13 points or 0.15% at 7338.99
Germany’s Dax edged up 0.06% to 11,966.14
France’s Cac closed down 0.35% at 4955.00 on continuing concerns about the presidential election
Italy’s FTSE MIB added 0.03% to 19,455.05
Spain’s Ibex ended down 0.02% at 9801.7
In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.05% to 643.16
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 26 points or 0.12%.

On that note, it’t time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and come back tomorrow for our coverage of the UK budget.
