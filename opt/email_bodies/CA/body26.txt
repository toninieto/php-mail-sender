There’s been a multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical deal, more fallout from the Brexit vote and markets are jittery ahead of a speech later in the week from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, on what was originally looking like a quiet summer Monday.

On the Brexit front, financial firms believe the impact of the vote to leave the European Union has not so far been as stark as expected. But the UK housing market is likely to contract next year in the wake of the decision, said estate agents Countrywide.

Meanwhile, markets are heading lower and the dollar is climbing again ahead of any interest rate comments from Janet Yellen at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday. Investors are uncertain about the prospect for rates, given that last week’s dovish Fed minutes were followed by comments from Fed members including Stanley Fischer suggesting a rate rise could yet happen shortly.

Oil has come under pressure as hopes fade that OPEC may come up with an agreement to support prices at its meeting next month. In a note today, Morgan Stanley suggested any deal was unlikely. The strength of the dollar is also having an impact on the crude price.

And on the deal front, Pfizer is paying $14bn for cancer specialist Medivation.

On the markets, the FTSE 100 is currently down 41 points or 0.6%, Germany’s Dax has dropped 0.79% and France’s Cac is 0.4% lower. European markets have seen their declines accelerate as Wall Street opens. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 80 points in early trading.

On that note, we’ll close up for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow.
